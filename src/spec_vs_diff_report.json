  "summary": "The diff implements a refactor from per-coating door entries to size-based grouping with coating columns. Backend now stores one record per unique door size with multiple coating selections. Frontend displays one row per size with separate coating amount columns. Totals section changed to show Total Sq.Ft and separate coating totals instead of Grand Total. Rates removed from UI/PDF. Confirmation message updated to show door size count. All requirements appear implemented.",
