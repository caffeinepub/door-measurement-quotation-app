All requirements appear to be addressed: DoorEntryList.tsx is not shown in the diff (possibly not modified or truncated), but GrandTotals.tsx, pdfGenerator.ts, whatsappShare.ts, and coatingRates.ts all demonstrate the required changes to calculate and display all four coating types for every door with proper formatting.",

      "reason": "DoorEntryList.tsx does not appear in the modified files list or diff content. The file summary indicates it displays entries grouped by size but provides no evidence of the coating calculation changes.",
