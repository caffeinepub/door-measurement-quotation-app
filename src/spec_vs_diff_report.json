  "summary": "The diff shows comprehensive implementation of all requirements. pdfGenerator.ts and whatsappShare.ts were updated to display entered dimensions with fractions using decimalToFractionDisplay(). The note about rounding was updated to 'Calculations are done as per standard carpenter rules.' However, no evidence of changes to DoorEntryList.tsx is present in the diff, leaving REQ-4 unverified. REQ-5 (print view verification) cannot be confirmed without test evidence or explicit print-related code changes.",

      "reason": "DoorEntryList.tsx is mentioned in frontend-file-summaries.txt as 'Displays door entries table grouped by size' but the file does not appear in the modified files list. No evidence of changes to web view dimension display logic.",
