  "summary": "The diff comprehensively implements all requirements to fix duplicate door size entries. Backend now uses unique IDs with Map storage, frontend displays all entries individually without grouping, and PDF/WhatsApp outputs list each entry separately. All requirements appear to be satisfied.",

      "description": "Backend uses Map<Nat, DoorEntry> instead of array-based storage",
      "reason": "REQ-1 explicitly requested 'array-based storage' but backend/main.mo uses 'let entries = Map.empty<Nat, DoorEntry>()' and returns entries.values().toArray() in getAll(). The storage mechanism is a Map, not an array.",
