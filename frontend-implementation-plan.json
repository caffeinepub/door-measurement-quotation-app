Ensure each query includes an 'enabled' flag that checks actor availability before executing. Verify query keys are stable and do not cause unnecessary refetches. Add proper null/undefined checks for the actor before calling backend methods. Ensure error handling correctly distinguishes between actor unavailability and actual backend errors."
