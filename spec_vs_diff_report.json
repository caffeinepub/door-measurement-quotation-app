  "summary": "The diff shows only one file was meaningfully modified: `frontend/src/utils/dimensionRounding.ts`, which correctly implements REQ-1. However, REQ-2 through REQ-6 require updates to `squareFeetCalculator.ts`, `pdfGenerator.ts`, `DoorEntryList.tsx`, `GrandTotals.tsx`, `QuotationActions.tsx`, and `whatsappShare.ts` — none of which appear in the diff as modified files. The project_state.json and frontend-file-summaries.txt show all new feature requests are still marked 'pending', confirming the implementation is incomplete.",
