The backend/main.mo was updated with proper getAll() and getTotals() query methods that return valid responses without trapping. The frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts was updated with actor availability checks (enabled flag tied to actor being non-null and not fetching), safe default returns, and retry:false to prevent false error states.",
